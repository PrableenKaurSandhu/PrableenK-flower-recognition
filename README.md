# PrableenK-flower-recognition
The flower recognition system based on image processing has been developed using Convolutional Neural Network.

Without flowers, beauty is incomplete. We are surrounded by flowers. On sidewalks, in gardens,
and on a college campus, we see them everywhere, yet we are unable to identify them. Me being an
environmentalist and an urban farmer (so to say) find it difficult at times when it comes to
identifying flowers. In that case, I chose this idea to research and develop my project on. The main
objective of this project is to design and build a system that automatically identifies an image of a
flower by implementing machine learning models and image processing techniques. This project is
an attempt at using the concepts of neural networks to create an image classifier by Tensorflow.
Convolutional neural networks are a preferred realm of machine learning and are widely used in
image classification. Thus, I chose this topic to research image classification by CNN and
Tensorflow. On completion of this project, I had a better understanding of machine learning, and
image processing, which was my primary focus. Though I developed an model of my research
project I have a lot of plans to do more research to upgrade my system in the future.
